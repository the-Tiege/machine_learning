# Feature Engineering and Learning Curves

Welcome to the Feature Engineering and Learning Curves GitHub repository! This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate essential aspects of feature engineering and learning curve analysis. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced practitioner seeking insights, this repository has something for you.

## Notebooks

### 1. Feature Engineering Notebook
Explore the power of feature engineering with our comprehensive notebook. Learn how to:

- Identify relevant features
- Handle missing data
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale and normalize features
- Extract meaningful information from existing features
- and more!

This notebook serves as a practical guide with hands-on examples using popular libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn.

### 2. Learning Curves Notebook
Dive into the world of learning curves and gain insights into your machine learning models. In this notebook, you'll discover:

- How to interpret learning curves
